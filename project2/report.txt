a. The obstacle I ran into was not being able to get my code on the G++ server. Eventually, I realized that I was typing in erroneous commands and was able to run it on the server. 

b. I know that in discussion we were asked to make a table for these test cases, but I was not able to make a table in plain text format. 

Normal Test Cases: 
1. Input: Ticket, Lunch. 
	Output: Thank you for eating at UCLA today.  Your meal cost is $14.50.
	Reason: Test 'Ticket' and 'Lunch.' 

2. Input: Ticket, Dinner. 
	Output: Thank you for eating at UCLA today.  Your meal cost is $17.00.
	Reason: Test 'Ticket' and a different meal time. 

3. Input: BruinCard, Breakfast, Staff. 
	Output: Thank you for eating at UCLA today.  Your meal cost is $11.25.
	Reason: Test 'BruinCard' and 'Staff.' 

4. Input: BruinCard, Lunch, Student, No. 
	Output: Thank you for eating at UCLA today.  Your meal cost is $11.75.
	Reason: Test 'BruinCard' and 'Student' instead of 'Staff,' and 'No' to being a 		resident.  

5. Input: BruinCard, Dinner, Student, Yes. 
	Output: Thank you for eating at UCLA today.  Your meal cost is $12.25.
	Reason: Test 'Yes' to the Resident question instead of 'No.'
