a. The only obstacle I had to overcome was understanding how all the classes fit together and which header files had to be imported into which classes. I originally imported too many files in each class, which caused the program to not build. 

b. Test Data: 

Ticket t( "Pavillion Row 13", 405, "Dodgers vs. Brewers", "Dodger Stadium", 150.00, Ticket::MOVIE, "August 1, 7:30PM" );
BoxOffice b;
